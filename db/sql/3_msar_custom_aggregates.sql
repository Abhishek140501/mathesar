/*
This script defines all the necessary functions to be used for custom aggregates.

Currently, we have the following custom aggregate(s):
  - msar.peak_time(time): Calculate the 'average time' (interpreted as peak time) for a column.

Refer to the official documentation of PostgreSQL custom aggregates to learn more.
link: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xaggr.html

We'll use snake_case for legibility and to avoid collisions with internal PostgreSQL naming
conventions.

Takes a column of type time and calculates the peak time.

Steps:
  - Convert time to degrees.

  - Calculate the inverse tangent from the state point.
  - Convert this to time, which is the result.
