# Mathesar Documentation


## Welcome!
Mathesar is an self-hostable open source project that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators work with data â€“ no technical skills needed. You can use Mathesar to edit data, set up and change your data structure, and to build custom reports.

You can either set up a new PostgreSQL database while setting up Mathesar or use Mathesar to interact with an existing database (or do both).

This documentation site is aimed at Mathesar administrators and end users.

## Getting started

- [Install Mathesar](installation/index.md)
- [Configure Environment Variables](configuration/env-variables.md)

## Product
Mathesar should be pretty intuitive to use. More documentation is coming soon, but for now, we've written some documentation for some things that could be tricky.

- [Syncing Database Changes](./user-guide/syncing-db.md)
- [Users & Access Levels](./user-guide/users.md)
